## I decided to first work on all the training set files and then the test set files.
## In this section I am working on the training set files.
## I will first process the subject (volunteer) ID file, followed by the activity ID 
## file, and finally the actual data file (the various readings). I will 
## merge them all by mathing the row positions.

## Read subject ID text file into data frame
SubjTrain <- read.table("subject_train.txt")

## Change name of v1 to a descriptive label
names(SubjTrain)[1] <- 'subjectID' 

## Create an explicit variable to store the sequential row position as 
## an integer for merging
SubjTrain$seqID <- as.integer(row.names(SubjTrain))

##
## Now work on file containing activity labels
##
## read activity text file into data frame
ActivityTrain <- read.table("y_train.txt")

## change name of v1 to a descritive name
names(ActivityTrain)[1] <- 'activity' 

## Create an explicit variable to store the sequential row position as 
## an integer for merging
ActivityTrain$seqID <- as.integer(row.names(ActivityTrain))

## Merge subject IDs and activity IDs into one file
SubjActTrain <- merge(SubjTrain, ActivityTrain, by="seqID")

## Although the group to which the data were assigned (train vs test) is not relevant
## for the current exercise, I like to keep that information for future analyses
## such as trying to predict the activity from the features (a classification problem)

## Add training set identifier
SubjActTrain <- addCol(SubjActTrain, group = "train")

## Change group from a list to a character vector
SubjActTrain$group <- as.character(SubjActTrain$group)

## This next part reads and processes the movement data (features)
## Read training group performance data into data frame
## THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE...
DFTrain <- read.table("X_train.txt")

## Read the feature names into data frame (to be used as column/variable names)
features <- read.table("features.txt")  

## Drop first variable (sequence number) and transpose to row array
featureNames <- t(features[-1])         

## Attach column names to top of performance data
colnames(DFTrain) <- featureNames 

## Retain only columns with -mean() or -std() in the variable name
DTrainFin <- DFTrain[, grep("-mean[[:punct:]]|-std[[:punct:]]",names(DFTrain))]

## Remove parentheses from column names
colnames(DTrainFin) <- gsub(pattern = "\\(|)", replacement = "", x = names(DTrainFin))

## Create an explicit variable to store the sequential row position as 
## an integer for merging
DTrainFin$seqID <- as.integer(row.names(DTrainFin))

## merge labels data file with activity file to create a tidy data file for the training data
SubjActFeatTrain <- merge(SubjActTrain, DTrainFin, by="seqID")
